But such a man may yet make merry , for Heaven & Hell have equal part in him . Infidelity's friend is black all over and takes on a murky hue , while the man of loyal temper holds to the white . This winged companion is too swift for unripe wits . They lack the power to grasp it . For it will wrench past them like a startled horse ! So it is with a dull mirror or a blind man's dream . These several faces in dim outline : but the dark image does not abide , it gives but a moments joy . Who tweaks my palm where never a hair did grow ? He would have learnt close grips indeed ! Were I to cry Oh !', in fear of that it would mark me as a fool . Shall I find loyalty where it must vanish , like fire in a well , or dew in the sun ? On the other hand I have yet to meet a man so wise that he would not gladly know what guidance this story requires , what edification it brings . The tale never loses heart , but flees and pursues , turns tail and wheels to the attack and doles out blame and praise . The man who follows all these vicissitudes and neither outs too long or goes astray and otherwise knows where he stands has been well served by mother wit . Feigned friendship leads to the fire , it destroy a man's nobility like hail . Its loyalty is so short in the tail that if it meet in the wood with gadflies it will not quit a bet in three . These manifold distinctions do not all relate to men . I shall set these marks as a challenge to women . Let any who would learn from me beware to whom she makes free of her love and precious person , lest she regret the loss of both chastity and affection . With God as my witness I bid good women observe restraint . The lock guarding all good ways is modesty - I need not wish them any better fortune . The false will gain a name for falsity - How lasting is thin ice in August's torrid sun ? Their credit will pass as soon away . The beauty of many has been praised far and wide ; but if their hearts be counterfeit I rate them as I should a bead set in gold .

Feigned friendship leads to the fire , it destroys a man's nobility like hail . Its loyalty is so short in the tail that if it meet in the wood with gadflies it will not quit a bit in three . These manifold distinctions do not all relate to men . I shall set these marks as a challenge to women . Let any who would learn from me beware to whom she takes her honour and good name , beware whom she makes free of her love and precious person , lest she regret the loss of both chastity and affection . With God as my witness I bid good women observe restraint . The lock guarding all good ways is modesty - I need not wish them any better fortune . The false will gain a name for falsity . - How lasting is thin ice in August's torrid sun ? Their credit will pass as soon away . The beauty of many has been praised far and wide ; but if their hearts be counterfeit I rate them as I should a bead set in gold . But I do not reckon it a tawdry thing when the noble ruby with all its virtues is fashioned into base brass for this I would liken to the spirit of true womanhood . When a woman acts to the best of her nature you will not find me surveying her complexion or probing what shields her heart : if she be well proofed within her breast her good name is safe from harm . Now if I were to judge of men and women as I know them a long story it would be . Hear , then , what manner of tale this is , telling of things both pleasant and sad , with joy and trouble for company . Grant there were three of me , each with skill to match mine : there would still be need of unbridled inspiration to tell you what , single-handed , I have a mind to tell ! I will renew a tale that tells of great fidelity , of inborn womanhood and manly virtue so straight as never was bent in any test of hardness . Steel that he was , his courage never failed him , his conquering hand siezed many a glorious prize when he came to battle Dauntless man , though laggard in discretion ! - Thus I salute the hero - Sweet balm to women's eyes , yet women's heart's disease ! Shunner of all wrongdoing ! As yet he is unborn to this story whom I have chosen for the part , the man of whom this tale is told and all the marvels in it . There is a custom still observed today wherever our western neighbours' laws prevail . It holds even on German soil in one odd corner - you don't need me to tell you that ! Whoever it was that held these territories yonder ruled - nor was it shame to him - that the eldest brother ( strange though true ) should have his father's whole inheritance . That death should sever the rights of which their father's life assured them was the cadets' misfortune . Before , they held in common . Now , the eldest holds alone . Was that not a wise man who laid it down that age should have possessions ? - Youth has its fill of good things , eld of sighs and sorrows '! - There never was a fate so pitiful as age cum poverty !' I will not palter with the truth : that kings , counts , dukes should suffer dispossesion of their acres , all but the oldest son - what an outlandish ordinance ! \"}"
